      "desc": "Interactive prototype developed for Valencia Design Week. This artistic installation invites reflection on the hidden environmental impact of artificial intelligence, inspired by Plato's allegory of the cave. The central piece is made with 3D-printed ceramic clay and algae bioplastic, integrating touch sensors connected to Arduino. When interacting, projections generated with p5.js are activated, showing data on the consumption of materials, water, energy, and waste associated with AI. The work combines art, technology, and ecological awareness."
